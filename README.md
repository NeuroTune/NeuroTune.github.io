# NeuroTune Single Neuron Modeling and Simulations

This site presents core concepts and models in computational neuroscience. We begin with single-neuron modeling, including the classic Leaky Integrate-and-Fire, Hodgkin-Huxley, and Connor-Stevens models, which capture the electrical behavior of individual neurons through varying levels of biophysical detail. Additionally, we will offer sample simulations to demonstrate how neuron behavior can be modeled and visualized using our simulator, NeuronTune.

This website will be exploring neuron modeling at the single-cell level, based on established models. We will provide detailed formulas and theoretical frameworks, primarily derived from the work of Dayan and Abbott, to describe the behavior of individual neurons, focusing on their electrical properties and dynamics.
